`chainladder-python` - Property and Casualty Loss Reserving in Python

Welcome! The `chainladder-python` package was built to be able to handle all of your actuarial needs in python. It consists of popular actuarial tools, such as triangle data manipulation, link ratios calculation, and IBNR estimates using both deterministic and stochastic models. We build this package so you no longer have to rely on outdated softwares and tools when performing actuarial pricing or reserving indications.

This package strives to be minimalistic in needing its own API. The syntax mimics popular packages such as [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) for data manipulation and [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/) for model construction. An actuary that is already familiar with these tools will be able to pick up this package with ease. You will be able to save your mental energy for actual actuarial work.
